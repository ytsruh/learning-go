/*
There are different ways to persist data depending on your needs:

RDB (Redis Database): This is a snapshot of the data that is created at regular intervals according to the configuration. For example, every 3 minutes or every 10 minutes, depending on how you configure it. In this method, Redis takes a complete copy of the data in memory and saves it to a file. When a restart or crash occurs, the data is reloaded from the RDB file.

AOF (Append only file): In this method, Redis records each command in the file as RESP. When a restart occurs, Redis reads all the RESP commands from the AOF file and executes them in memory.
*/
